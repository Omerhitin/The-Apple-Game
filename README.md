# The Apple Game
In this project I used my laptop integrated camera and implemented motion detection, noise cleaning and filtering techniques using the OpenCV library, which is used mainly for real-time computer vision purposes.

The goal of the game is simple: to catch the apples that appear on the screen with your own hands, as if the apples were actually a part of the surrounding space, while avoiding the half eaten ones.

This project was created for self-learning purpose, as I was curious about the Opencv library and its uses (and for entertainng some younger family members towards the New Hebrew Year).

I invite you to test your fine motor skills and run this code.

## Requirements:
* Web camera
* Python 3.8
* Pygame
* Opencv
* Numpy
* Runpy

## Launch the game
* Download all .py files and the 'files' directory, and place them all in the same directory.
* Run the 'Main Menu.py' file.
* The game instructions are available at the game main menu.
