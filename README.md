# The Apple Game
In this game, apples will pop on the screen, and the player's goal is to catch as many apples as he/she can.
This project was created for self-learning purpose, as I found an interest in the Opencv library and its uses (and to entertain some younger family members towards the New Hebrew Year).
I invite you to test your fine motor skills and run this code.

#Requirements:
Python 3.6
Pygame
Opencv
Numpy
Runpy

#Launching the game
Download all .py files and the 'files' directory, and place them all in the same directory.
Run the 'Main Menu.py' file.
The game instructions are available at the game main menu when it opens.
